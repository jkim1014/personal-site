#### Intro
I am a student at Harvard studying Computer Science and Physics. I was born and raised the first half of my life in Seoul, South Korea, then fell in love with Miami after immigration. I enjoy growing empathy as a product manager advocating for customers and learning the best modern engineering practices as a software engineer.
<br><br>
I am passionate about teaching CS concepts, learning about consumers with B2C products, and working with honest and innovative designs. I am particularly interested in incremental social impact with education and perpetuating ethical decisions when building products.

#### Currently
At Addis Coder, I have had the ultimate pleasure of working with 180+ highschool students selected by the Ethiopian government to create and teach an intensive 4-week algorithms and programming class. I am working with 25 other beautiful individuals from across the world to collaborate on lecture materials and problem sets, to receive feedback on my own teaching, and to show students exciting problem solving opportunities in computer science. Students in the program come from a broad spectrum of experience level; some students knew of recursion while some students had never typed on a computer before.
<br><br>
At Break the Love, I have been ideating and engineering software products alongside select passionate individuals who are just as eager, if not more, as I am about creating a marketplace for handful of sports players in need of places to play, primarily tennis. I am learning to think critically about easy to use design, incorporating innovative design patterns I have encountered previously, and piecing together a scalable platform using best practices in Javascript web development to reach one step closer to our goal each day.

#### I am making progress in
- Bringing equal opportunity for all.
- Growing empathy for all family, friends, and acquaintances.
- Being the best version of myself each day to grow personally and technically.
- Learning about scalable systems.

#### Some History

- I first touched a computer when my older siblings introduced a Lego car racing game burnt onto a CD (Windows 98 by the way). This might have been when I found out that I should not be a pro-racer in the future.

- My first Rubik's cube solve happened at the age of 7. It took me at least 5 frustrations and 13 crying sessions. Now, it only takes me 2 frustrations and -1 crying sessions.

- I first competed in mathematics contests at the age of 8. My mother did not warn me of what I was getting myself into.

- I moved to the United States in 2007. I turned 9 years old shortly after.

- I took my first computer science course at the end of my highschool senior year. Java coding did not interest me until Asteroids game coding project rolled into our class.

- I have had the fortunate experience of learning web development through an entirely student-led company. I see it as an incredibly useful and flexible tool in my life now.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

#### Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised for the first 9 years in Seoul, South Korea. I immigrated to the U.S. in 2007 and graduated highschool in Miami, FL. I study in Cambridge, MA next to a beautiful Charles River.

- I've been to 13 countries. Some memories have escaped me so I would like to revisit.

- I hope to make my next international destination to be Japan

#### Fun Facts

- My favorite city in the world is New York.
- I always carry a hand sanitizer with me (you never know what situations call for)!
- I once was serious about becoming a professional soccer player.
- I added this page so no one can complain that my site is just an elaborate resume.
